The most tiny tiny world for a single shard. 

Save your rocks! Because without earthquakes nor meteors, the limiting factor is going to be rocks! You'll find yourself farming moleworms, seeking out sea stacks, sharks and Antlion and rummaging the Junk Pile just to collect the few rocks they give!

This tininess is a bit extreme. For a more moderate version please see: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2987796038
